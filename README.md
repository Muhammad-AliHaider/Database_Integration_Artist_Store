# Database_Integration_Artist_Store
 A dataBase Integration Node Application working majorly on Api Integration
 
 
Functionalites Of the Application:

The system can manage the details of customers, paintings, and those paintings currently on hire to customers. Customers are categorized as B (bronze), S (silver), G (gold) or P (platinum). These categories entitle a customer to a discount of 0%, 5%, 10% or 15% respectively.
Some Cases Are:
Customers often request paintings by a particular artist or theme (eg animal, landscape, seascape, naval, still‚Äêlife, etc). Over time a customer may hire the same painting more than once. Each painting is allocated a customer monthly rental price defined by the owner. The owner of the painting is then paid 10% of that customer rental price.

Any paintings that are not hired within six months are returned to the owner. However, after three months, an owner may resubmit a returned painting.

Each painting can only have one artist associated with it. Several reports are required from the system. Three main ones are: 
For each customer, a report showing an overview of all the paintings they have hired or are currently hiring
For each artist, a report of all paintings submitted for hire
For each artist, a returns report for those paintings
